\# Playground



A home for the things I learn, a lot of this repo will be capstone projects or just me playing around with various programming languages.



The reason it is here though is because my laptop is prone to dying and I would actually like to keep the things I work on so I will be setting up some kind of auto job to make a backup of this on the daily.
